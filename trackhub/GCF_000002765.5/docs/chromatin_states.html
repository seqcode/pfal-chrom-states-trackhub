<h1>Chromatin States</h1>

<p>Chromatin states were generated with ChromHMM (Ernst &amp; Kellis,
2012). Figure 1 below shows the chromatin state names and colors
followed by the emissions profiles, relative enrichment over gene
features, genomic coverage, gene counts associated with each state, and
expression values associated with each state. See paper methods for
details on how these were calculated.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Chromatin states in the Plasmodium IDC and
associated feature enrichments. <strong>A)</strong> Hidden Markov Model
emission probabilities discovered by ChromHMM. <strong>B)</strong>
Relative enrichment of each state at a selection of genomic features.
<strong>C)</strong> The genomic coverage of each state at each
timepoint. R= ring stage (10hpi), T= trophozoites (30hpi), and S=
schizont stage (40hpi). <strong>D)</strong> The number of genes that
have each state located at the start of the coding sequence at each
timepoint. <strong>E)</strong> Z-score values for the average gene
expression value per chromatin state.</p>
